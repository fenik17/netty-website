I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.54.Final. This is mainly a bug-fix release. 

The most important changes in this release are:

* Use special exception when failing because the SSLEngine was closed ([#10783](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10783))
* codec-http2: Correct last-stream-id for HEADERS-triggered connection error ([#10775](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10775))
* Drop unknown frames on connection stream ([#10771](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10771))
* Avoid auto boxing in PoolChunk#removeAvailRun ([#10769](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10769))
* Add reflection config for JMX runtime ([#10753](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10753))

* Minor performance improvement in websocket upgrade ([#10710](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10710))
* We should have a special config that allows to configure half closure for DuplexChannel ([#10701](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10701))
* Allow EventLoops to rethrow Error ([#10694](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10694))

* Better hash algorithm in FingerprintTrustManagerFactory ([#10683](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10683)) 
* Fix #10614 by making UnorderedTPEExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate run tasks more than once ([#10659](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10659))
