I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.11.Final. 

This release introduces two new abstractions that allows:

* Preload classes before calling native OnLoad function to prevent classloader leak ([#260](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/260))
* Only access static field once we ensured we could load the native lib ([#255](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/255))
* Update quiche so we can support QUIC v1 as well ([#256](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/256))
* Allow to configure which QUIC version is used ([#254](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/254))
* Allow the user to query which QUIC versions are currently supported ([#253](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/253))
* Allows use direct buffers when trying to read from a stream ([#247](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/247))

Beside these there are various other small changes.
