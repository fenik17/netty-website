We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.80.Final.

This release is mainly a bug-fix release but also comes with a change which improves the performance of HTTP/1.x dramatically when using multiple cores. If you are interested in in JVM and performance check out all the details written down in([#12709](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12709)).

The most important changes are:
