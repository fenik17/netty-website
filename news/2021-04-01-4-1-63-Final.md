title: 'Netty 4.1.63.Final released - Regression fix'
author: normanmaurer

Today we decided that we should do another netty release as just after we released  [4.1.62.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/milestone/237?closed=1) we noticed another regression that could lead to an re-entrance problem in the `SslHandler`. This could cause encoding problems in some rare cases. As the `SslHandler` is a critical component of netty we think a quick release is warranted. 

For more details please see ([#11133](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11133)).
