We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.78.Final.
This release is a bug-fix release.
The most important changes are:

* Fix a bug where an OPT record was added to DNS queries that already had such a record ([#12370](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12370))
* Fix a bug that caused an error when files uploaded with HTTP POST contained a backslash in their name ([#12334](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12334))
* Fix an issue in the BlockHound integration that could occasionally cause `NetUtil` to be reported as performing blocking operations ([#12414](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12414))
* A similar BlockHound issue was fixed for the `JdkSslContext` ([#12435](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12435))
* Fix a bug that prevented preface or settings frames from being flushed, when an HTTP2 connection was established with prior-knowledge ([#12349](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12349))
* Fixes a rare `NullPointerException` that could occur when a `ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine` threw an `OutOfMemoryError` from its constructor, and was then later finalized ([#12434](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12434))
* The `SslHandler` now adds the socket file descriptor to the BIOs, when the SslEngine supports this (boringssl and libressl), which allow tracing and observability tools to monitor encryption traffic on a per-connection basis. ([#12438](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12438))
* It is now possible to explicitly step the scheduling clock in `EmbeddedEventLoop`, which is useful for making automated tests with deterministic scheduling ([#12459](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12459))
