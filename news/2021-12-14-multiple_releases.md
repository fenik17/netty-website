I am happy to announce the release of multiple of our incubator libraries to follow the release of [netty 4.1.72.Final](https://netty.io/news/2021/12/13/4-1-72-Final.html). Beside upgrading to the latest netty release these releases also contain a few other small fixes.

The releases include:

 * [netty-incubator-transport-io_uring 0.0.11.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-transport-io_uring/milestone/11?closed=1)
 * [netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.25.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.25.Final)
 * [netty-incubator-codec-http3 0.0.11.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-http3/milestone/11?closed=1)
