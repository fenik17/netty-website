title: 'Netty/Incubator/Codec/Quic 0.0.8.Final released'
author: normanmaurer
---

I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.8.Final, just after our release of netty 4.1.60.Final earlier today.

This release not only fixes a few bugs but also makes use of the new [GSO](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11038) support in netty if the `EpollDatagramChannel` is used. This change helps to improve the throughput in our benchmarks quite a bit when running [h2load](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/tree/quic) (patched for QUIC / HTTP3 support) against our [HTTP3](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-http3) implementation.

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/milestone/7?closed=1). 

The most important changes are:

* Add support for qlog ([#197](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/197))
* Add QuicStreamLimitChangedEvent that will be fired once we can create more streams again ([#198](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/198))
* Ensure we always call quiche_conn_on_timeout(...) when a timeout is about to run ([#206](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/206))
* Rewrite QuicheQuicStreamChannel to not do any extra queued and also handle writability better ([#208](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/208))
* Update to latest quiche commit ([#211](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/211))
* Support shutting down the stream with an error code ([#213](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/213))
* Make use of GSO when possible  ([#204](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/204))
