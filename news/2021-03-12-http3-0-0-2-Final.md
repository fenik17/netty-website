After we just announce the initial release of our http3 codec a week ago I am happy to announce the next release today. This release fixes various bugs and now fully pass the [h3spec http3 tests](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/h3spec).
Beside bug-fixes we also upgraded to [netty 4.1.60.Final](https://netty.io/news/2021/03/09/4-1-60-Final.html) and [netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.8.Final](https://netty.io/news/2021/03/09/quic-0-0-8-Final.html).

For more details on how to make use of this code please read our [initial announcement](https://netty.io/news/2021/03/04/http3-0-0-1-Final.html).
