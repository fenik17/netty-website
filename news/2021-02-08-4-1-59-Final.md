I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.59.Final, which beside fixing various bugs also contains a security fix which may affect you if you use the `HttpPostRequestDecoder` or `HttpPostMultiPartRequestDecoder`.

For more details about the impact of the CVE check the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2).


The most important changes are:

* Correctly filter out TLSv1.3 ciphers if TLSv1.3 is not enabled ([#10919](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10919))
* Allow blocking calls in UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider#parse ([#10935](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10935))
* Ignore priority frames for non existing streams and so prevent a NPE ([#10943](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10943))
* Make native loading logging less confusing ([#10944](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10944))
* Use GracefulShutdown when stream space is exhausted ([#10946](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10946))

* Fix possible SEGV when using native dns resolver on macos ([#10971](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10971))
* Revert "Enable SSL_MODE_ENABLE_FALSE_START if jdkCompatibilityMode is false ([#10980](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10980)) 
* Introduce SslContextOption which can be used for "optional" features in SslContext implementations ([#10981](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10981)) 
* Fix memory release failure when "maxNumElems == 1" of PoolSubpage ([#10988](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10988))
