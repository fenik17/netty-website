We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.70.Final.  This is mainly a bug-fix release. That said it contains an important fix that can cause "malformated" HTTP responses / requests when you use the `SslHandler` and chunked encoding. Because of this we highly recommend upgrading as soon as possible.

The most important changes are:

* Fix gzip decoding when FLG.FHCRC is set ([#11805](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11805))
* Make static final buffers unreleasable and read-only ([#11802](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11802))
* Move java classes out of the native modules ([#11798](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11798))
* Exclude transitive dependencies of rarely used modules from netty-all ([#11786](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11786))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.70.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.70.Final).
