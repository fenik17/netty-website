I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.24.Final, which beside bug-fixes also introduce support for 0-RTT on the client-side. 


The most important changes are:

* Add zero rtt support for client ([#362](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/362))
* Correctly set cache size and timeout ([#366](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/366))
* Correctly fire SslHandshakeCompletionEvent.SUCCESS on the client side ([#367](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/367))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.24.Final).
