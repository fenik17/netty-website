We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.72.Final just a few days since our last release. We decided to do so as our release did introduce a regression in our bom which could lead to dependency issues. Beside this we also upgraded the log4j2 version of our optional dependency (which also means that while we use it it will not be automatically pulled in and so there is no risk from netty's point of view).

The most important changes are:

* Update tcnative version in bom ([#11902](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11902))
* Specify the platform version and deployment target on macos ([#11906](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11906))
* Update to log4j2 2.15.0 to fix security issue ([#11909](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11909))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.72.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.72.Final).
