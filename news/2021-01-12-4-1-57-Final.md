I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.57.Final. This releases is a bug-fix release.


The most important changes in this release are:

* We need to ensure we always drain the error stack when a callback throws 
 ([#10920](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10920))
* Add PushPromise and Priority Frame support in Http2FrameCodec ([#10765](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10765))
* Improve performance of HPACK static table lookup ([#10840](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10840))
* MQTT codec: foolproof SUBSCRIBE QoS encoding ([#10874](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10874))
* Ensure we only register native methods once ([#10876](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10876))
