I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.56.Final. This releases fixes a regression in the `HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder` which was introduced in the last release that could lead to an infinite loop. If you make use of this class you should upgrade ASAP!

The most important changes in this release are:

* Fix Bundle-NativeCode in MANIFEST file ([#10867](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10867))
* Workaround possible JDK bug in SSLEngineImpl when using TLSv1.3 that lead to multiple notifications ([#10860](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10860))
* Fix infinite loop decoding multipart requests  ([#10855](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10855))
* Ensure IovArray is usuable without sun.misc.Unsafe ([#10870](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10870))
* Improve logging in `DnsServerAddressStreamProviders` ([#10848](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10848))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.56.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.56.Final). 

# Special notes

As this release includes a fix for a possible infinite loop it's advised to upgrade asap if you use 4.1.55.Final.
