I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.53.Final. This is mainly a bug-fix release but also fixes some regressions that may effect you.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Fix regression when trying to bind an EpollDatagramChannel with port only ([#10552](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10552))
* Fix NPE with MqttUnsubAckMessage - regression of MQTT5 support ([#10557](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10557))
* Fix DeleteOnExitHook cause memory leak ([#10560](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10560))
* Not truncate MQTT SUBACK reason codes ([#10584](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10584))
* Only create ConnectTimeoutException if really needed ([#10595](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10595))
* Correctly report back when we fail to select the key material and ensure we wrap(...) until everything was produced ([#10610](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10610))
* Only set the keymaterial once and correctly handle errors during keymaterial setting on the client-side as well ([#10613](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10613))
* Avoid integer overflow in ByteBuf.ensureWritable ([#10648](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10648))
