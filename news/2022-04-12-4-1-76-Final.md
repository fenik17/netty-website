We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.76.Final. This release is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* Upgraded the optional `netty-tcnative` dependency to version 2.0.51.Final ([#12162](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12162))
* Upgraded the optional `log4j` dependency to version 2.17.2 ([#12261](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12261))
* The `netty-all` module now declare an automatic module name, making it useable with Java Modules. ([#12188](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12188))
* It is now possible to configure arbitrary socket options for the native epoll and kqueue transports. Refer to your operating system documentation for what options are available. ([#12246](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12246))
* It is now possible to explicitly bind channels to either IPv4 or IPv6. ([#12270](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12270))
* The HTTP/2 header validation that rejects duplicate pseudo-headers, which was added in 4.1.75.Final, has been changed so it no longer breaks older versions of gRPC. ([#12289](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12289))
* Fix a `NullPointerException` that was hiding the real cause of certain  HTTP/2 header decoding errors. ([#12232](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12232))
