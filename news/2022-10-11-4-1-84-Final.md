We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.84.Final.
This release is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* HTTP/2 header _values_ with invalid characters are now rejected in header validation ([#12760](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12760))
* We now automatically generate conditional meta-data for native-image use, making GraalVM support more reliable ([#12794](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12794))
* Fix a scalability issue caused by `instanceof` and `check-cast` checks that lead to false-sharing on the `Klass::secondary_super_cache` field in the JVM (See [JDK-8180450](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8180450)) ([#12806](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12806))
* Made the HTTP/2 HPACK static table implementation faster by using a [perfect hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function) ([#12713](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12713))
* Fixed a bug in our `PEMParser` when PEM files have multiple objects, and BouncyCastle is on the classpath ([#12864](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12864))

### Note on 4.1.83.Final

The Netty 4.1.83.Final version suffered a mis-compilation in the macOS KQueue native binaries during the release process.
Apart from the macOS specific native code integrations, there are no differences between the 4.1.83.Final and 4.1.84.Final versions we've released to Maven Central.
