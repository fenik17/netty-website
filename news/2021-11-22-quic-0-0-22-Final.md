I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.22.Final, which is a bug-fix release and also fixes a regression.


The changes are:

* Ensure CLOSE_FRAME can be produced when forceClose() is called ([#360](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/360))
* Remove Channel from map on timeout ([#359](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/359))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.22.Final).
