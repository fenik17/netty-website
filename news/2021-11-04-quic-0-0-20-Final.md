I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.20.Final. 

This release fixes a few bugs and also introduce the ability for SSL keylogging and so be able to debug via wireshark.

The most interesting changes are:

* Correctly delete global references when free SSL_CTX ([#344](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/344))
* Guard against reentrancy in forceClose() ([#345](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/345))
* add keylog support using SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback ([#343](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/343))
* Ensure we generate a correct OSGI compatible manifest for all our jars ([#347](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/347))

Beside these there are various other small changes.
