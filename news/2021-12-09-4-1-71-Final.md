We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.71.Final.  This is mainly a bug-fix release but also contains [a fix for HTTP-request-smuggling](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wx5j-54mm-rqqq) and fixes a regression in `SslHandler`. Because of this we urge everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

The most important changes are:

* HTTP fails to validate against control chars in header names which may lead to HTTP request smuggling ([CVE-2021-43797](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wx5j-54mm-rqqq))
* JdkZlibEncoder can use pooled heap buffers for deflater input ([#11891](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11891))
* Ensure we always run the register task of native libraries ([#11887](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11887))
* Rewrite and simplify Recycler ([#11858](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11858))
* Do not allow third parties to provide Netty's native libraries ([#11856](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11856))
* Fix reentrancy bug in SslHandler which can cause IllegalReferenceCountException ([#11854](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11854))
* Correctly handle InputStream.read() when it return -1 during writing to the ByteBuf ([#11837](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11837))
