We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.85.Final.
This release is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* A bug in `FlowControlHandler` that broke auto-read has been fixed ([#12467](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12467))
* The HTTP/2 HPACK encoder is now faster at encoding headers that have many values ([#12665](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12665))
* A potential memory leak bug has been fixed in the pooled allocator ([#12897](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12897))
* Fix an issue with the Blockhound integration, which could cause the `MacOSDnsServerAddressStreamProvider`
  to be flagged as making blocking calls ([#12913](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12913))
* Inconsitencies in how epoll, kqueue, and NIO handle RDHUP have been fixed ([#12930](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12930))
* `ByteToMessageDecoder` now handle situations where the same `ByteBuf` instance is read multiple times ([#12922](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12922))
* The check that ensures the HTTP/1 `Content-Length` header is unique, now no longer causes headers to be rearranged (change their order) ([#12921](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12921))
* Fix a `NullPointerException` bug with class initialisation order between `InternalLogger` and `InternalThreadLocalMap` ([#12942](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12942))
* When the `netty-resolver-dns-native-macos` classes can't load their native bindings, they now only print a short error message instead of the huge stack trace it printed previously. The stack trace is still included if DEBUG logging is enabled ([#12950](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12950))
* The Graal native-image meta-data is now placed in the recommended location, and no longer causes warnings to be printed ([#12951](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12951))
* The HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 codecs now properly support RFC 8297 Early Hints ([#12918](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12918))
* Subclasses of `FastThreadLocalThread` can now tell the Netty Blockhound integration that they should be allowed to make blocking calls ([#12978](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12978))
* Validation of HTTP/2 connection headers have been moved from `Http2Headers` to `HpackDecoder`, so that outgoing headers are not validated ([#12975](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12975))
