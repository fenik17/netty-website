We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.82.Final.
This release is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* Fix a NullPointerException bug when calling `forEachByte` on nested `CompositeByteBuf`s ([#12790](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12790))
* Relax an overly strict HTTP/2 header validation check that was rejecting requests from Chrome and Firefox ([#12799](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12799))
* The OpenSSL and BoringSSL implementations now respect the `jdk.tls.client.protocols` and `jdk.tls.server.protocols` system properties, making them react to these in the same way the JDK SSL provider does ([#12797](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12797))

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts, and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area.

Please report an unintended omission.
