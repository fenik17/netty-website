I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.58.Final, which contains only one bug-fix which fixes a regression which could cause the native libs to be not loaded correctly. This regression was introduced in netty 4.1.57.Final, which was released just yesterday. Due the nature of the regression we decided we should offer another release (with a fix) ASAP.


The related issue / pr for the regression can be found in the provided links:

* Revert "Ensure we only register native methods once" ([#10928](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10928))
* 4.1.57 could not load a native library: netty_transport_native_unix_linux aarch_64/x86_64 ([#10926](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10926))


# Thank You
