Just after releasing netty [4.1.61.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/milestone/236?closed=1) yesterday we decided to do a quick followup release a.k.a netty [4.1.612.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/milestone/237?closed=1).  to fix a regression that slipped in. The regression affects only users that use the native KQueue transport. For more details please see ([#11128](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11128)). Special thanks to [@violetagg](https://github.com/violetagg) for reporting the regression in such a fast manner and also providing a fix for it!
