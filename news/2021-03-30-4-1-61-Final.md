I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.61.Final, which beside fixing various bugs also contains a security fix which may affect you if you use the `codec-http2` package and proxy HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. This fix is a follow up of the previous fix done as part of [CVE-2021-21295](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj) as we missed to handle one case.

For more details about the impact of the CVE (CVE-2021-21409) check the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-f256-j965-7f32).

The most important changes are:

* Validate Content-Length header in HTTP/2 decoder ([CVE-2021-21409](https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/b0fa4d5aab4215f3c22ce6123dd8dd5f38dc0432))
* Add support for UDP_GRO ([#11120](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11120))
* DefaultThreadFactory must not use Thread.currentThread() when constructed without ThreadGroup ([#11119](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11119))
* Let's use gcc10 when cross-compiling for LSE support ([#11112](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11112))
* Allow to have an empty path when convert a CONNECT request ([#11108](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11108))
* Ensure we can correctly propagate exceptions to streams even if endStream flag is set ([#11105](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11105))
* Do not send GOAWAY frame before connection preface ([#11107](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11107))
* Continue reading when the number of bytes is less then the configured number of bytes when using DatagramChannels ([#11089](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11089))
* Allow to configure the maximum number of message to write per eventloop ([#11086](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11086))
* SslHandler flushing with TCP Fast Open fix ([#11077](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11077))
* Also support CompositeByteBuf with SegmentedDatagramPacket ([#11081](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11081))
* Return correct result for Futures that are returned from UnorderedThreadPoolExecutor ([#11074](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11074))
* Fix alignment handling for pooled direct buffers ([#11106](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/11106))

# Important notes

## CVE-2021-21409 - request smuggling

This release fixes a possible security problem which have allowes for request smuggling, check the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-f256-j965-7f32) for more details.

## GRO support for `EpollDatagramChannel`

This release also adds support for GRO (`UDP_SEGMENT`) when using the native `EpollDatagramChannel` and running on a system with a recent enough kernel. You can make use of this by using the `EpollChannelOption.UDP_GRO` option.

For more detail on GRO please read [the LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/768995/) which explains how this can be used to maximize performance when using `QUIC`.

## LSE support for AARCH64

This release switched to use GCC10 for cross-compiling and so enable the usage of LSE when running on AARCH64. Using LSE can have a huge performance impact. For more details please read the [MySQL on ARM blogpost](https://mysqlonarm.github.io/ARM-LSE-and-MySQL/).
