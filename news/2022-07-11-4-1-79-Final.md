We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.79.Final.
This release is a bug-fix release.
The most important changes are:

* The PEM certificate parser is no longer susceptible to exponential back-off ([#12476](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12476))
* Non-standard extra ampersands in HTTP POST bodies are no longer rejected ([#12427](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12427))
* An `io.netty.osClassifiers` system property has been added to avoid reading `os-release` files ([#12483](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12483))
* Fix a bug in `SslHandler` so `handlerRemoved` works properly even if `handlerAdded` throws an exception ([#12490](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12490))
* Use the correct OSGi processor directive on aarch64, making it possible to use OSGi on ARM ([#12349](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12349))
* HTTP paths that begin with a double-slash are now parsed the same way browsers do ([#12533](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12533))
* The `isCompleted` flag is now correctly preserved on objects from `HttpData.retainedDuplicate()` ([#12438](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12438))
* The `HttpUtil.isOriginForm()` and `isAsteriskForm()` methods now correctly conform with RFC 7230 ([#12568](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12568))
* Fix an issue that allowed the multicast methods on `EpollDatagramChannel` to be called outside of an event-loop thread ([#12584](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12584))
* Support for the LoongArch64 processor architecture has been added ([#12580](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12580))
