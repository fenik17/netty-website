We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.77.Final. This release is a bug-fix release, which also contains a fix for a CVE which only affects users running Java 6.
Beside this it also fixes a bug which can cause the native epoll transport to be unusable on systems that not implement `epoll_pwait2` (like ubuntu 22.04.
The most important changes are:

* Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Netty on Unix-Like systems due temporary files for Java 6 and lower in io.netty:netty-codec-http ([CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q))
* Upgraded the optional `netty-tcnative` dependency to version 2.0.52.Final ([#12162](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12361))
* Fix a bug where Netty fails to load a shaded native library  ([#12358](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12358))
* Include classifier in Automatic-Module-Name ([#12354](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12354))
* Check if epoll_pwait2 is implemented ([#12345](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12345))
* Don't call strdup on packagePrefix ([#12322](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12322))
* Enable debugging of asynchronous tasks in Intellij ([#12319](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12319))
* Throwing an exception in case glibc is missing instead of segfaulting the JVM ([#11701](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/11701))
