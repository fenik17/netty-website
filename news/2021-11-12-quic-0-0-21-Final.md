I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.21.Final. This is mainly a feature release!

__Important:__ This release changes the artifactId from  `netty-incubator-codec-quic` to `netty-incubator-codec-native-quic` to ensure that its possible to depend on multiple different architectures without ending up with duplicated classes on the classpath. Please change your dependency informations to reflect this.

The changes are:

* Split native and classes to extra modules ([#357](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/357))
* Add zero rtt support for server ([#356](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/356))
* Use a CompositeByteBuf for GSO ([#355](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/355))
