I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.17.Final. 

This release fixes a few bugs but also introduced support for SNI.

The most interesting changes are:

* Correctly use jlong and jint in native function definition to fix possible segfault ([#311](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/311))
* Ensure the connectPromise is also notified when the channel is closed due the draining timeout ([#312](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/312))
* Add support for SNI ([#313](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/313))

Beside these there are various other small changes.
